# Project: Billboard Songs and Lyrics visualization using RShiny
Data visualization of Billboard Year-end top 100 Songs and Lyrics (1964 - 2015)

This project is aimed at utlizing `R Shiny`, a special package in R that enables rich visualization of data by building an application to run the programmed visualization on the web.

The data source is Kaggle. Billboard publishes a Year-End hot 100 songs every December. This data is collected for years 1964 - 2015 and is combined to get a combined dataset with songs and lyrics. The dataset contains 5100 records and 6 columns including Rank, Song, Artist, Year, Lyrics and Source.

Using this dataset, an Rshiny app is deployed and following visualizations are presented:
    1. Rank Analysis of Artists across the entire timeline (1964 - 2015)
    2. Analysis of frequent words in lyrics of all the listed songs
    3. Comparitive analysis of frequent words in Song Lyrics
    4. Analysis of frquent words in Song Titles for all the listed songs
    5. Comparitive analysis of frequent words in Song Titles
    6. Yearwise analysis of Artists with maximum hits
    7. Cumulative analysis of Top Artists (atleast 12 hits in the 1964 - 2015 timeline) considering their career timeline of 1964 - 2015
